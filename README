DESCRIPTION

This archive contains the source code for the website http://perldoc.perl.org,
which holds the core documentaion for Perl in HTML and PDF formats.


USAGE

  perl build-perldoc-pdf.pl --output-path /path/to/output
  perl build-perldoc-static.pl --output-path /path/to/output
  perl build-perldoc-html.pl --output-path /path/to/output --input-path /usr/share/perl/5.10/pod/ --cache syntax.cache

  To create localized versions of perldoc:
  Download POD2::XX from CPAN and unzip it to some directory.

French

  wget http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/P/PO/POLGAB/POD2-FR-0.02.tar.gz
  tar xzf POD2-FR-0.02.tar.gz
  mkdir fr
  perl build-perldoc-html.pl --output-path fr --input-path POD2-FR-0.02/FR --cache fr.syntax.cache
  perl build-perldoc-static.pl --output-path fr

  It took 16 minutes to process the French files.
  (BTW the French docs are also available here:  http://perl.enstimac.fr/DocFr.html )

Italian

  wget http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/E/EN/ENRYS/POD2-IT-0.12.tar.gz
  tar xzf POD2-IT-0.12.tar.gz
  
  mkdir it
  perl build-perldoc-static.pl --output-path it
  perl build-perldoc-html.pl --output-path it --input-path POD2-IT-0.12/IT --cache it.syntax.cache

NOTES

Please be aware that this software was written for the specific purpose
of generating the perldoc.perl.org website, and not to solve generic
problems like "convert a directory of Pod to HTML" or "produce documentation
for Perl and all modules installed on my system". However, the templates,
CSS, and conversion routines should give you a head start should you wish
to write a more generic tool.

COMMENTS 

by Gabor Szabo

The modified version of Pod::POM 0.17 was removed. We should see if the new
version of Pod::POM provides what is needed.

The processing is very slow, one ran of Devel::NYTProf after shortcutting
the processing loop pointed to a large number of calls to GetOptions 
internals possibly by Perl::Tidy.

The syntax.cache needs some improvement maybe saving file-by-file in a 
cache directory?

The input-path was added as the directories were not 
discovered correctly on my computer. This needs to be cleaned up.

How do we generate the main index.html page ?
